        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this assignment, I implemented a series of geometric algorithms and operations to manipulate and refine
            3D meshes,
            focusing on the construction and evaluation of Bézier curves and surfaces, computing area-weighted vertex
            normals, and
            performing mesh editing operations like edge flips and splits. The highlight of the assignment was the
            implementation of
            the Loop subdivision algorithm, which significantly refines and smooths mesh surfaces by iteratively
            updating vertex
            positions and subdividing the mesh into finer triangles. This process involved a detailed understanding of
            mesh
            topology, including vertices, edges, and faces, and required careful consideration of how to maintain the
            mesh's
            connectivity and integrity after each operation.

            One interesting aspect I learned from this assignment is how geometric algorithms can be applied to create
            smooth and
            detailed 3D models from coarse meshes. The transformation of a simple cube into a smoother, more complex
            shape using
            Loop subdivision was particularly fascinating, demonstrating how repeated application of subdivision rules
            can
            approximate a smooth limit surface. Additionally, the edge flip and split operations underscored the
            importance of mesh
            topology and the need for careful updates to vertex, edge, and face references to preserve the mesh
            structure, which is
            crucial for 3D modeling and computer graphics applications.

        <h2>Task 1: Bézier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h2>
        <h3>de Casteljau's algorithm and its implementation</h3>
        <p>De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive method used to evaluate and construct Bézier curves. The algorithm
            operates based on a set of control points that define the shape of the curve. The fundamental idea is to
            linearly
            interpolate between these control points, progressively reducing the number of points until a single point
            is
            obtained,
            which lies on the Bézier curve for a given parameter value <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mi>t</mi>
            </math>, where <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mn>0</mn>
                <mo>&le;</mo>
                <mi>t</mi>
                <mo>&le;</mo>
                <mn>1</mn>
            </math>.</p>
        <p>My implementation takes a set of control or intermediate points as input and generates a new set of points by
            linearly interpolating between each pair of consecutive points using the formula <math
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mo>(</mo>
                <mn>1</mn>
                <mo>&minus;</mo>
                <mi>t</mi>
                <mo>)</mo>
                <mo>&times;</mo>
                <mtext>points</mtext>
                <mo>[</mo>
                <mi>i</mi>
                <mo>]</mo>
                <mo>+</mo>
                <mi>t</mi>
                <mo>&times;</mo>

                <mn>1</mn>
                <mo>]</mo>
            </math>. This step reduces the total number of points, moving closer to the final
            curve point. The function returns these newly computed points, which can then be used in subsequent
            iterations of
            the process until a single point, lying on the Bézier curve for the specified <math
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mi>t</mi>
            </math>, is obtained. This
            iterative process mirrors the recursive nature of de Casteljau's algorithm, where each step brings the
            points closer
            to the curve.</p>

        <h2>Task 2: Bézier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h2>
        <p>The de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bézier surfaces by applying the same principle used for Bézier curves
            to a two-dimensional grid of control points, allowing the construction and evaluation of smooth surfaces.
            Each
            control point in this grid influences the surface shape, and the algorithm computes points on the surface by
            interpolating between these control points in two parameters, typically denoted as <math
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mi>u</mi>
            </math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mi>v</mi>
            </math>, which range from 0 to 1.
            This two-parameter approach enables the creation of complex, curved surfaces.</p>
        <p>In my implementation, the <code>evaluateStep</code> function performs one iteration of the de Casteljau's
            algorithm
            for a given set of 3D points and an interpolation parameter <math
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mi>t</mi>
            </math>. It linearly interpolates between each
            pair of consecutive points in the input vector using the formula <math

                <mo>]</mo>
            </math> to produce a new set of intermediate points. This function is used within
            <code>evaluate1D</code>, which applies the de Casteljau algorithm iteratively to reduce the set of points
            down to a
            single point,
            representing a position on the Bézier curve defined by one parameter (either <math
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mi>u</mi>
            </math> or <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mi>v</mi>
            </math>).
        </p>
        <p>The <code>evaluate</code> function extends this concept to Bézier surfaces by first applying
            <code>evaluate1D</code>
            along one
            parameter direction (say, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mi>u</mi>
            </math>) for each set of control points that define curves in the <math
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mi>u</mi>
            </math> direction, thereby
            reducing the two-dimensional grid of control points to a single-dimensional set of points. It then applies
            <code>evaluate1D</code> again, but this time along the other parameter direction (say, <math
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mi>v</mi>
            </math>), to this set of points
            to obtain the final point on the Bézier surface for the parameters <math
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mo>(</mo>
                <mi>u</mi>
                <mo>,</mo>
                <mi>v</mi>
                <mo>)</mo>
            </math>. This two-step process
            effectively evaluates the Bézier surface by iteratively reducing the dimensionality of the control points
            set, first
            from two dimensions to one, and then from one dimension to a single point on the surface.

        <h2>Task 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h2>
        <p>
        <p>In my implementation for computing area-weighted vertex normals, the algorithm approximates the normal at a
            vertex by
            averaging the normals of all adjacent triangles. The area weighting comes from
            the
            fact that the cross product of two vectors forming a triangle not only gives a vector vertical to the
            triangle but also has a magnitude proportional to the area of the parallelogram spanned by
            the two
            vectors. </p>
        <p>The implementation steps are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Initialization</strong>: A <code>Vector3D</code> named <code>normal</code> is initialized to (0,
                0, 0) to
                accumulate the weighted normals.</li>
            <li><strong>Iterating Over Neighboring Triangles</strong>:For each non-boundary triangle, the positions of
                its vertices (<code>v0</code>, <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code>) are
                obtained. The vector from <code>v0</code> to <code>v1</code> and the vector from <code>v0</code> to
                <code>v2</code> are
                used to compute the cross product, which yields a normal vector for the triangle and proportional to its
                area.
                This normal is then added to the <code>normal</code> vector, weighted by the triangle's area.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Next Triangle</strong>: After dealing with one triangle, move to the next one that shares the
                vertex, skip if it is in the boundary, and
                repeat the process.</li>
            <li><strong>Normalization</strong>: Once all connected triangles have been considered, normalize the
                accumulated
                vector to ensure it a proper normal.</li>

        <h2>Task 4: Edge Flip</h2>
        <h3>Explaination</h3>
        <p>In my implementation of the edge flip operation, I've followed a systematic approach to rewire the
            connections between vertices, edges, and faces in a mesh to effectively "flip" an edge. The process involves
            several steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identifying the Elements</strong>: I start by identifying all the half-edges, vertices, and
                faces involved in the operation. This includes the half-edges emanating from the edge to be flipped (h0
                and h3), their immediate next half-edges in the loop (h1, h2, h4, h5), and the vertices at the ends of
                the original edge and the vertices opposite to it in the adjoining faces (v0 to v5).</li>
            <li><strong>Boundary Check</strong>: I ensure that the edge to be flipped is not on the boundary of the mesh
                because flipping a boundary edge is undefined.</li>
            <li><strong>Rewire Half-Edges</strong>: The core of the operation involves reassigning the 'next', 'twin',
                'vertex', 'edge', and 'face' pointers of the involved half-edges to effectively change the connectivity
                in the mesh. This reassignment redirects the half-edges to form two new triangles from the previous
                configuration, effectively flipping the common edge.</li>
            <li><strong>Update Faces</strong>: The 'halfedge' pointers of the two faces involved in the flip are updated
                to point to one of the half-edges that now form their new boundaries.</li>
            <li><strong>Update Vertices</strong>: The 'halfedge' pointers of the vertices involved in the flip
                (specifically, the vertices that were connected by the flipped edge) are updated to point to new
                half-edges that emanate from them after the flip.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This method ensures that the connectivity of the mesh is maintained correctly after the edge flip, with the
            flipped edge connecting the vertices that were previously opposite to it in the adjoining faces. The
            operation returns an iterator to the flipped edge, although the actual edge object remains the same; only
            its connectivity within the mesh is altered.</p>
        <h3>Implementation and Debugging</h3>
        <p>In the process of implementation, I first drew the shapes with flipped edges on paper. To minimize the number
            of
            modifications, I retained the names of each edge before and after flipping. In the most original
            implementation, I did
            not update the half-edge each face pointed to, so when flipping multiple times, holes would appear in the
            teapot.
            Fortunately, this problem was solved after I updated the half-edge pointed to by each face. However, at this
            point, I
            still had not assigned the half-edge pointed to by the vertices, and this bug was not discovered and fixed
            until later
            parts.</p>
        <p>
            This part went relatively smoothly once it was confirmed that each edge was correctly updating its
            neighbors. Updating
            the faces successfully got the code running.

        <h2>Edge Split</h2>
        <h3>Explaination</h3>
        <p>In the implementation of the edge split operation, the goal is to divide an existing edge in a mesh into two
            by
            introducing a new vertex along the edge. Here's an overview of the process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boundary Check</strong>: First, I check if the edge is on the boundary of the mesh. If it is,
                the
                operation is not performed, and one of the original vertices of the edge is returned.</li>
            <li><strong>Identifying Elements</strong>: The half-edges, vertices, and faces involved in the
                split are identified.
                This includes the half-edges associated with the edge to be split (h0, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5), the vertices
                at the
                ends of the edge (v0, v1), and the faces adjacent to the edge (f0, f1).</li>
            <li><strong>Creating New Elements</strong>: A new vertex is created at the midpoint of the edge.
                Additionally, new
                half-edges, edges, and faces are created to accommodate the changes in the mesh's topology caused by the
                split.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Updating Connectivity</strong>: The most complex part of the operation involves correctly
                setting the
                'next', 'twin', 'vertex', 'edge', and 'face' pointers for the original and new half-edges, ensuring the
                mesh's
                connectivity is correctly maintained. This reassignment essentially splits the edge and the adjacent
                faces,
                redistributing the half-edges among the newly formed faces.</li>
            <li><strong>Assigning Edge and Face References</strong>: The 'halfedge' references of the new and original
                edges and
                faces are updated to point to appropriate half-edges that bound them.</li>
            <li><strong>Updating Vertex References</strong>: The 'halfedge' references of the original vertices and the
                new
                vertex are updated to reflect the changes in their connectivity.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Implementation and Debugging</h3>
        <p>
            In this part, I followed the method from the previous section. I drew the changes in the shapes before and
            after on
            paper and assigned a set of names to each half-edge. After going through the debugging process in the
            previous section,
            the implementation of this part was very smooth, and the code ran successfully on the first try. Of course,
            just like in
            the previous section, the issue of reassigning half-edges to each vertex was not discovered until the final
            part.

        <h2>Task 6: Loop Subdivision</h2>
        <h3>
            Explanation
        </h3>
        <p>In my implementation of the Loop subdivision algorithm within the <code>upsample</code> function, the goal
            was to
            refine the mesh, increasing its number of triangles and smoothing the surface. Loop subdivision is
            particularly
            suited for this task, as it defines a smooth limit surface through a series of refinement steps. Here's an
            overview
            of the process I followed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Updating Vertex Positions:</strong> For each vertex in the original mesh, I calculated a new
                position
                based on the Loop subdivision rules. This involves averaging the positions of neighboring vertices,
                adjusted by
                a weighting factor that depends on the number of neighbors. This new position aims to smooth out the
                mesh by
                relocating vertices to more optimal positions.</li>
            <li><strong>Storing Edge Midpoints:</strong> I computed new positions for the midpoints of all edges, which
                are the
                positions of new vertices to be added during subdivision. These positions are determined by averaging
                the
                positions of the edge's endpoints and the opposite vertices of the adjoining faces, with specific
                weights as
                prescribed by Loop's rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Splitting Edges:</strong> I iterated through each edge of the original mesh, splitting it to
                introduce a
                new vertex at its midpoint (calculated in step 2). This step increases the mesh's resolution. It's
                crucial to
                only split original edges to avoid infinite recursion.</li>
            <li><strong>Edge Flipping:</strong> To improve mesh topology and ensure a more uniform distribution of
                vertices, I
                flipped edges that connected an original vertex to a new vertex. This step helps in maintaining a more
                regular
                mesh structure after subdivision.</li>
            <li><strong>Finalizing Vertex Positions:</strong> Lastly, I updated each vertex's position to the new
                position
                calculated in the first step. This step is essential for moving the vertices to their new, smoothed
                locations,
                completing the subdivision process.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Implementation and Debugging</h3>
        <p>In this part, the comments in the code provided enough hints, so the process of writing the code was
            relatively
            smooth. The biggest difficulty was distinguishing between the newly added edges that needed to be flipped
            and those
            that did not: initially, I set the <code>isnew</code> attribute of the edges that did not need flipping to
            <code>false</code>, but this caused the edge-splitting process to continue indefinitely. Setting it to
            <code>true</code>, on the other hand, would cause these edges to be flipped.
        </p>

        <p>I located the positions where these bugs appeared by commenting out different parts of the code separately. I
            determined the edges that needed to be split by checking if both vertices of an edge were old, while setting
            the
            <code>isnew</code> attribute of the edges that did not need flipping to <code>false</code>, which smoothly
            solved
            most of the issues.
        </p>

        <p>Finally, following hints on Ed, I went back to the first two parts and updated all the
            edges
            pointed to by the vertices, successfully completing the code for this part.</p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            Loop subdivision makes meshes smoother and adds more details. When we use Loop subdivision, we split each
            edge to make
            more points, edges, and faces. This makes the mesh look finer and smoother. The process also rounds off
            sharp edges and
            makes the whole mesh look more even. As we keep subdividing, the mesh gets closer to a smooth shape. This
            makes the mesh look nicer. But, doing this also makes the mesh more complex, which means
            computers need
            to work harder to handle it.
        </p>
        <p>During each step of the surface subdivision process, old vertices are smoothed by the positions of the
            surrounding vertices.A challenge often encountered, especially with geometric shapes like cubes, is that the
            corners and edges appear to be excessively pulled towards the center. By
            pre-splitting the
            edges, the influence of the corner vertices is distributed more evenly, which effectively
            alleviated this problem. See the image
            below.</p>

        <p>Noticing that each face of the initial cube is divided by two triangles, for the vertices of the cube, some
            are more
            influenced by the adjacent vertices on the right-angle sides of these triangles (closer distance), while
            others are more
            influenced by the vertices adjacent to the hypotenuse (greater distance). Therefore, the vertices are not
            uniformly
            influenced by their neighboring vertices, leading to asymmetrical issues in the shape.</p>
        <p>By pre-splitting the hypotenuse on each face of the cube, we can redistribute the influence more
            uniformly.This additional step ensures that vertex are semmetrically distributed on the cube, which
            improves the symmetry of the shape upon subdivision.</p>
